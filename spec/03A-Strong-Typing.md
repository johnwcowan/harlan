**3A: Strong Typing.  The language shall be strongly typed. The type of each variable, array and record component, expression, function, and parameter shall be determinable during translation.**

Explicit ypes are required on all function and subroutine arguments.

Explicit ypes are optional on mutable variables and
mutable components of a record in order to
provide a wider type for the variable
than the expression that initializes it.

All other types are inferred.
