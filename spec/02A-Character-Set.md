**2A: Character Set.  The full set of character graphics that may be used in source programs shall be given in the language definition. Every source program shall also have a representation that uses only the following 55 character subset of the ASCII graphics: (omitted) Each additional graphic (i.e., one in the full set but not in the 55 character set) may be replaced by a sequence of (one or more) characters from the 55 character set without altering the semantics of the program. The replacement sequence shall be specified in the language definition.**

The 55-character subset is considered obsolete in 2020.  Only the ASCII repertoire is needed to write code.

Literal strings can contain any character except those of the Cc general character class.
