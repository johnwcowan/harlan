**6D: Short Circuit Evaluation.  There shall be infix control operations for short circuit conjunction and disjunction of the controlling Boolean expression in conditional and iterative control structures.**

Conjunction is `and then` and disjunction is `or else`.
They cannot be overloaded.
They are unrelated to the ordinary `and` and `or` boolean operators.
